# Battle

This is a rpg battle script made in Python.

Some things are not fully functional and I will list here later.
If you want to test with other attributes (HP, attack etc ...) or more players and enemies, simply edit the file **main.py**, add more players and enemies, or simply change the values.

Made with the help of a Python course at Udemy you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-complete/).
